          <h1>A Most Posty Post</h1>
          <h3> Written 1/3/2000</h3>
          <h2> First thoughts...</h2>
          <p>Perhaps it would be a night idea to catalog my html and css into a time capsule to myself that will only unlock on my 51st birthday so I can revel in the horror and have a good checker to see how far I have come I reckon.</p>
          <h2> Additional Thoughts...</h2>
          <p> Maybe I will throw some music in there while I'm at it with the time capsule. I reckon the flaming lips cover of sgt peppers would trip me out a great deal in the future. Miley Cyrus was a bold choice to have jump in on some of their songs.... not sure if it was the right choice....

          <p>Blunt force hard coding: okay now, nightmare later.</p>
          <p>If I respect my health I should probably find a non-cigarette-smoking activity to do for my break every 4 pomodoros. Dat nicotine do. Note to self: purchase those fancy e cig things..... </p>

          <h3> Written 1/1/2000</h3>
          <h2>Be it resolved</h2>
          <p>I've never been a huge fan of new years resolutions because I think they're either too vague or too impossible to be accomplished. However I came up with one this year that gives me the whole year to do it and is finite and measurable.</p>
          <p>I will be trying to run 300 miles over the course of the year, which means if I fall behind early I will have a cray summer. Better put some miles on this winter</p>
