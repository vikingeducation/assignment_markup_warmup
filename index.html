                    Set up media queries so the page operates like the one in the second mockup.
                    Play with it to make sure the element layouts behave as expected when you cross the breakpoint.
                    Commit to Github.
                    Finally, refactor and clean up redundancies in your styles or markup. Try to conform to the best practices we covered earlier. Now is when you aim for good-looking code.
