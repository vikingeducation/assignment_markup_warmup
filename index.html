          <h5>First Thoughts</h5>
          <p>Chuck ipsum. Chuck Norris doesn’t need to swallow when eating food. Chuck Norris once kicked a baby elephant into puberty. Chuck Norris’ roundhouse kick is so powerful, it can be seen from outer space by the naked eye. Chuck Norris does not hunt because the word hunting infers the probability of failure. Chuck Norris goes killing.</p>

          <h5>Only Thoughts...</h5>
          <p>Cat ipsum dolor sit amet, hunt anything that moves or hopped up on goofballs hide when guests come over.
