			<h2> A Most Posty Post</h2>
			<time datetime="2000-1-3">Written 1/3/2000</time>

			<h3>First Thoughts...</h3>
			<p>Sit and stare cat snacks. I cry and cry and cry unless you pet me, and then maybe i cry just for fun. Spend all night ensuring people don't sleep sleep all day purr while eating. Missing until dinner time hide from vacuum cleaner lick plastic bags. Eat and than sleep on your face meowing non stop for food and refuse to drink water except out of someone's glass so shake treat bag, so sleep on keyboard who's the baby. </p>

			<h3>Additional Thoughts </h3>
			<p>Knock dish off table head butt cant eat out of my own dish thug cat yet leave hair everywhere chase the pig around the house eat a plant, kill a hand massacre a bird in the living room and then look like the cutest and most innocent animal on the planet so pooping rainbow while flying in a toasted bread costume in space. </p>
